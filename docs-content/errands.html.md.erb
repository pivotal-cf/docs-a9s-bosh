Errands are tasks which are executed after a tile installation/update (Post-Deploy Errands) or before a tile gets deleted (Pre-Delete Errands). The a9s BOSH for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) tile provides two errands which can be disabled in the **Errands** panes of the tile configuration:

##<a id='cloud-config-updater'></a> Run Cloud Config Updater Errand

The Cloud Config Updater errand uploads the Cloud Config YAML specified in the **Cloud Config** tab. In case you deactivate this errands, changes in the **Cloud Config** pane would not have any effects.

If this errand is never executed with a proper Cloud Config, the a9s service tiles will not be able to provision service instances.

##<a id='bosh-configurator'></a> Run BOSH Configurator Errand

The BOSH configurator errand uploads the required stemcells to the a9s BOSH director.

##<a id='bosh-cleaner'></a> Run BOSH Cleaner Errand

When the a9s BOSH for PCF tile will be uninstalled, this errands takes care no deployment, orphaned disk or any other artefact remains.
